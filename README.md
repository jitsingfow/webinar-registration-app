Simple Registration App
=======================

Description
-----------

This is a basic web application where users can fill out a registration form. The app saves the registration data to a MongoDB database.

Prerequisites
-------------

To run this app, you need to have the following installed:

1.  **Node.js**: This tool allows you to run JavaScript code on your computer.
2.  **Docker**: This tool helps you package and run applications in a container.

Download and install them from:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

Steps to Run the App
--------------------

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    Get the code for the app by running this command in your terminal:

    bash

    Copy code

    `git clone <repository-url>`

    Replace `<repository-url>` with the link to your app's code.

2.  **Navigate to the App Directory**

    Change to the app directory:

    bash

    Copy code

    `cd <repository-folder>`

    Replace `<repository-folder>` with the folder name where you downloaded the code.

3.  **Build and Run the App**

    Start the app using Docker:

    bash

    Copy code

    `docker-compose up`

    This command builds the app and starts both the app and the MongoDB database.

4.  **Open the App**

    Open your web browser and go to:

    arduino

    Copy code

    `http://localhost:3000`

    You'll see the registration form.

5.  **Use the Registration Form**

    Fill out the form and submit it. The data will be saved to the MongoDB database.

How It Works
------------

-   **Registration Form**: Users enter their information into a form on the website.
-   **Express.js**: Handles the server-side logic and routes for the form submission.
-   **MongoDB**: Stores the registration data.
-   **Docker**: Runs the app and MongoDB in isolated containers for easy setup and management.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you encounter any issues:

1.  Ensure Node.js and Docker are properly installed.
2.  Run `docker-compose up` from the root directory of the app.
3.  Check the terminal for any error messages and make sure MongoDB starts correctly.
